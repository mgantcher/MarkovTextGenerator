# MarkovTextGenerator
Generates text based on a variable-depth Markov chain and an input text/seed word of your choosing. 

Different texts want different depths; too big, and you'll end up looping through the most common words in the text over and over; too small, and the code tends to spount English-adjacent gibberish.
